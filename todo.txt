Oak
    Decide what effect to add to the Storage upgrades
    Medium and Large should boost Smalls formula

Skill Layers
    Should be challenges
    Goal is to get to a certain milestone in whatever layer the challenge is for
    Challenges disable bonuses from other trees
    And they should half gain or something to make them actually a challenge
    Rewards should be something more than just a basic bonus

Compactors
    Upon unlock add a buyable to all trees with their enchanted option unlocked
    starts with max 10 levels, unlocking higher tiers of compactors in the milestone tree with add new compactor buyables and increase level count
    First tier of compactor buyables only apply to first compacting tier for each resource
        So Diamonds would go (Diamonds>Enchanted Diamonds>Enchanted Diamond Blocks) but you need the tier2 for the enchanted block
    Compactor Levels cost Cobblestone
        Higher tiers cost Enchanted Cobble
    Redstone milestones increase level cap and reduce buyable price
        doesnt decrease the drain on top level resource
    I honestly have NO idea how to do this

Cobblestone
    Same base gain as Oak
    Still resets Work same as Oak
        This encourages minion rushing

    Buyables
        I think this layer just need Enchanted Cobblestone, maybe keep it in main area below upgrades?
