Oak
    Rework Enchanted Oak Logs into a side layer, like Super Boosters/Generators from TPTR
        Each EOL should boost Oak Log gain by 5%
        Move minion upgrades that cost EOL to the EOL layer
        Same for Storage upgrades which should be made to boost either work gain or all layers passivegen
        EOL should only reset current work amount
        Never max buy
        Make EOL have a line thing to O layer

    Storage Upgrades   
        These upgrades show in all gathering/generating layers
        They always cost Oak Logs and Enchanted Oak Logs
        Small Storage 64 Oak Logs
            Boosts passive gain
        Medium Storage 8 Enchanted Oak Logs
            Improves Small Storage formula
        Large Storage
            Improves Small Storage formula again

Skill Layers
    Should be challenges
    Goal is to get to a certain milestone in whatever layer the challenge is for
    Challenges disable bonuses from other trees
    And they should half gain or something to make them actually a challenge
    Rewards should be something more than just a basic bonus

Compactors
    Upon unlocks add a buyable to Enchanted layers
    Buyable should generate 1 of whatever enchanted item per level and drain same amount of the regular resource
    Buyable has cap of 10 to start with, meaning at best they can make 10 Enchanted X and drain 1600 Regular X
    Milestones in the cobblestone tree will unlock upgrades that increase the buyables cap
    These upgrades must be purchased in each tree after they are unlocked
    Further upgrades will be unlocked in the Redstone tree

    Now i just need to figure out how to do this

Cobblestone
    Same base gain as Oak
    Still resets Work same as Oak
        This encourages minion rushing

            +1 Work gain
        12 Promising Pickaxe 20 Cobble
            Boosts Cobblestone gain based on current Cobblestone
        13 Golden Pickaxe

            x2 Work gain
        14 Furnace 8 Cobble
            Requires Rookie Pickaxe
            Unlocks Charcoal Minion upgrade in all layers that costs oak and boosts that layers auto gain
            This upgrade costs 1 Oak
        15 Enchanted Furnace 64 Enchanted Cobble and 8 Enchanted Coal
            Requires Furnace and Milestone 8
            Unlocks Enchanted Charcoal Minion upgrade in all layers that costs oak and boosts that layers auto gain
            This upgrade costs 160 Oak
        21-25 and 31-35 are Minions
    
    Milestones
        1 50 Cobble Minion
        2 100 Unlock Mining Skill layer
        3 250 Unlocks Compactor layer
        4 1000 Enchanted Cobble
        5 2500 Compactor 2000
        6 5000 ph
        7 10000 ph
        8 25000 Unlocks Hyper Furnace Upgrade
        9 40000 Haste Ring
            Add this whenever you add talisman stuff, which should function like achievements
        10 70000 Compactor 3000

    Buyables
        I think this layer just need Enchanted Cobblestone, maybe keep it in main area below upgrades?
